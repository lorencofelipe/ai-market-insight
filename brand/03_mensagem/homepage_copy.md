## Copy Brief Summary

| Element | Decision |
|---------|----------|
| **Page type** | Homepage / Landing page |
| **Primary CTA** | Join the waitlist |
| **Target visitor** | Professional who needs market analysis but doesn't know dedicated tools exist (problem-aware) |
| **Main source of traffic** | LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Product Hunt, SEO |
| **Awareness level** | Problem-aware → needs to name the pain first |
| **Tone** | Confident, direct, clear, warm, data-first |
| **Social proof strategy** | Proof of Output + Framework Authority + Waitlist counter |
| **Anti-patterns** | No academic jargon, no "powered by AI", no emojis |

## Homepage Architecture (Section by Section)

### Why this order matters

```
Section 1 — Hero: Names the pain + shows the solution instantly
     ↓ (visitor thinks: "that's me" + "wow, look at that output")
Section 2 — How it works: Removes uncertainty ("is this hard?")
     ↓ (visitor thinks: "ok, that's simple")
Section 3 — Features: Shows depth ("what exactly do I get?")
     ↓ (visitor thinks: "this does everything I need")
Section 4 — Proof: Builds trust ("can I trust this?")
     ↓ (visitor thinks: "those frameworks are legit")
Section 5 — CTA: Captures intent ("I want in")
```

## Section 3: Features

### Copy

**Section heading:**
> Everything you need to validate your market

**Features grid:**

| Feature | Headline | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| 📊 | **Market Sizing** | TAM, SAM, and SOM calculated with transparent methodology. Top-down or bottom-up. Not a guess — a calculation. |
| 🔍 | **Competitor Discovery** | Find who you're up against. Funding, headcount, pricing, positioning — profiled and compared. |
| 🧩 | **Strategic Frameworks** | SWOT, Porter's 5 Forces, BCG Matrix — generated automatically. Ready for your pitch deck. |
| 📑 | **Sources, Not Guesses** | Every data point comes with its source. Confidence badges (🟢🟡🔴) so you know what to trust. |

### Feature Descriptions (expanded, for scroll)

**Market Sizing**
> Stop Googling your TAM. Enter your market parameters and get TAM, SAM, and SOM calculated using real methodology — not a paragraph copied from a blog. Bottom-up and top-down. With the math shown.

**Competitor Discovery**
> Describe your market. We find 6-8 competitors and profile each one: funding, headcount, pricing model, and positioning. Side-by-side comparison included.

**Strategic Frameworks**
> Porter's 5 Forces. BCG Matrix. SWOT Analysis. You shouldn't need an MBA to use these. Describe your business, and we generate them automatically.

**Sources, Not Guesses**
> Every number has a source. Every source has a confidence score. When we don't have reliable data, we tell you — instead of making it up.

**Proof line:**
> The same frameworks used by McKinsey, Bain, and BCG — without the $50K invoice.

## Decisions Made in This Phase

| # | Decision | Alternatives Discarded | Rationale |
|---|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Demo-first page structure | PAS only / BAB only | Shows product value instantly; best for problem-aware visitors |
| 2 | PAS opening in hero | Starting with benefit | Problem-aware visitors need to see their pain named before they care about the solution |
| 3 | Waitlist CTA (pre-launch) | Direct product access / Hybrid model | Builds audience, controls launch timing, feeds Product Hunt spike |
| 4 | Framework Authority as social proof | No social proof / Fake metrics | Borrows credibility from Porter/BCG/McKinsey without fabricating user numbers |
| 5 | Proof of Output (visual mockup) | Text-only description | "Show, don't tell" — the output IS the proof |
