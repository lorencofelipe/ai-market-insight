> Strategy: Full Build in Public
> Constraints: 0 followers, <3h/week, 100% organic, ASAP launch

## Reality Check

| Resource | What you have |
|----------|--------------|
| Followers | 0 |
| Email list | 0 |
| Budget for ads | $0 |
| Hours/week for marketing | <3h |
| Channels | Reddit, LinkedIn, X |
| Approach | Full Build in Public |

**This means:** Every tactic that requires money, large audience, or heavy time commitment is eliminated. What remains is high-leverage, zero-cost actions that compound over time.

## Launch Phases

### Phase 1: "Build in Public" (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal:** Go from 0 to first 50 waitlist signups

```
Week 1  → Ship landing page + first Reddit post
Week 2  → First LinkedIn build-in-public post
Week 3  → Show first product output (screenshot)
Week 4  → Share metrics transparently (waitlist count, hours spent)
```

**Actions:**

| Action | Where | Time | Expected result |
|--------|-------|------|----------------|
| Post "I'm building X because Y" story | Reddit (r/startups) | 30min | 5-20 waitlist signups |
| Post same story adapted for LinkedIn | LinkedIn | 15min | 3-10 connections |
| Share weekly update with metrics | Reddit + LinkedIn | 45min/week | Compound followers |
| Comment on 5 relevant posts per day | Reddit + LinkedIn | 15min/day | Build presence |

**Content templates for build-in-public:**

```
POST 1 (Launch story):
"I spent 4 hours trying to validate a startup idea with ChatGPT.
15 prompts. 10 tabs. None of the data matched.

So I'm building the tool I wish existed.

AI Market Insight: describe your idea, get the full market 
dossier. TAM, competitors, frameworks. One flow.

Week 1 stats:
- Lines of code: 2,400
- Hours spent: 18
- Waitlist: 0 (just shipped the landing page)
- Revenue: $0

Follow along. I'll share everything."
```

```
POST 2 (First output):
"Just got the TAM calculator working.

Input: 'B2B SaaS for HR teams'
Output: TAM $8.2B, SAM $1.8B, SOM $36M

[screenshot]

It took 47 seconds. No prompts. No tabs.

Week 2 stats:
- Waitlist: [number]
- Biggest challenge: [honest struggle]
- Next: competitor discovery engine"
```

```
POST 3 (Transparent metrics):
"Week 3 building AI Market Insight in public.

What went right:
- Competitor discovery finds 6-8 real companies
- Response time under 60 seconds

What went wrong:
- Scraper breaks on JavaScript-heavy sites
- Nobody on my waitlist has opened my email yet

Stats:
- Waitlist: [number]
- Code commits: [number]
- Hours this week: [number]

Shipping Porter's 5 Forces next week."
```

### Phase 2: "First Users" (Weeks 5-8)
**Goal:** 50 waitlist → 10-20 beta users with access

**Actions:**

| Action | Where | Time |
|--------|-------|------|
| Invite top 10-20 waitlist signups to beta | Email | 30min |
| Ask each beta user for 5 minutes of feedback | DM/Email | 1h/week |
| Post user feedback publicly (with permission) | Reddit + LinkedIn | 30min |
| Cross-post to IndieHackers with product page | IndieHackers | 30min |

**Key metric:** Do beta users come back a second time? If yes → product works. If no → fix before scaling.

---

### Phase 3: "Social Proof" (Weeks 9-12)
**Goal:** Get first testimonials and prepare Product Hunt launch

**Actions:**

| Action | Where | Time |
|--------|-------|------|
| Ask 3 best beta users for testimonial | Email/DM | 30min |
| Update homepage with real social proof | Website | 1h |
| Prep Product Hunt listing (screenshots, tagline, description) | Product Hunt | 2h |
| Build "teaser" hype: "Launching on PH next Tuesday" | Reddit + LinkedIn + X | 30min |

---

### Phase 4: "Product Hunt Launch" (Week 13+)
**Goal:** Spike of traffic + waitlist/signups

**Pre-launch checklist:**
- [ ] 3+ testimonials on homepage
- [ ] Product Hunt listing complete (5 screenshots, tagline, description)
- [ ] "Launching tomorrow" post scheduled on Reddit + LinkedIn + X
- [ ] Email to entire waitlist: "We're live on Product Hunt — support us"
- [ ] Personal DM to 20 people asking for upvote
- [ ] Hunter identified (ideally someone with PH following)

**Product Hunt copy (from Phase 2 identity):**

| Field | Copy |
|-------|------|
| **Tagline** | "Market validation for people who hate doing research" |
| **Description** | "Describe your business idea. Get TAM/SAM/SOM, competitor analysis, and strategic frameworks — with sources, in one flow. No prompts. No tabs." |
| **First comment** | Your build-in-public story: why you built it, transparent stats, and a genuine ask for feedback |

## Decisions Made in This Phase

| # | Decision | Alternatives Discarded | Rationale |
|---|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Full Build in Public | Soft BIP / Stealth launch | Maximum engagement from zero. Transparency builds trust with founders |
| 2 | Reddit as primary channel | LinkedIn first / X first | Highest organic reach for zero-follower accounts. Reddit rewards content, not followers |
| 3 | <3h/week routine | More ambitious schedule | Unrealistic commitments lead to burnout and inconsistency. Better to do 2.5h reliably |
| 4 | Product Hunt at Week 13 | Launch immediately / Never PH | Needs social proof first. Launching on PH with 0 testimonials = wasted opportunity |
| 5 | Weekly cadence, not daily | Daily posting | <3h/week doesn't support daily. Better to post 2x/week with quality |
